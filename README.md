The goal of this code is to implement a game with two independent units-the players-communicating with each other using sockets. When PlayerOne starts, it sends a random whole number to PlayerTwo. The receiving player is allowed to add one of three numbers {-1,0,1}, so that the result is divisible by 3. Then, it is devided by 3 and the result is sent to the other player. This goes until one player reaches 1 (after dividing). That player is the winner!
